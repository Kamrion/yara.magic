# yara.magic
yara rules for detect filetypes without using magic module in yara

rules may contain metainfo about corresponding filetype
- description. Some word about this filetype
- (optional) category. Based on my thinking. Need to be extender and detilizing

plans
- fix or split too slow rules 
- add extention(s) to corresponding filtypes
- add mechanism for test rules
